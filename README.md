## Exercise 6 (Optional)

**Problem:**
Bulls and Cows game:

- The computer generates a random 3-digit number (with non-repeating digits).
- The user guesses the number.
- After each guess, the program tells:
    - Bulls: Digits that are correct and in the right place.
    - Cows: Digits that are correct but in the wrong place.
- The game continues until the user guesses correctly (3 bulls).

**Example**

    Computer has chosen a 3-digit number. Try to guess it!
    
    Enter guess: 123
    Result: 1 bull(s), 1 cow(s)
    
    Enter guess: 456
    Result: 0 bull(s), 0 cow(s)
    
    Enter guess: 321
    Result: 0 bull(s), 3 cow(s)
    
    Enter guess: 135
    Result: 1 bull(s), 2 cow(s)
    
    Enter guess: 159
    Result: 3 bull(s), 0 cow(s)
    
    Congratulations! You guessed the number: 159
